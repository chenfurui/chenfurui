Slab Model；plot the energy-time curve ；

During the calculation, the overall structure does not change much, 
but there are a few ion steps in the middle that do not converge, 
so there will be spurious peaks in the curve.

try to change ALGO = F to ALGO = N.
The calculation is not over yet,
but it is found that the trend is relatively stable and there are no stray peaks
